# GAPIC Generators

Many of Google's API client libraries are automatically generated. 
These Generated API Clients (GAPICs) are produced from API descriptions
written in the Protocol Buffer language.

The tools and conventions that we use for this are open source.
The generators are published in the [googleapis GitHub organization](https://github.com/googleapis).
After beginning with an initial generator for all languages that was written in Java,
the team spent 2018 preparing a new set of generators, each written in the language
that it generates. Standards that we use for these generators are described here.
